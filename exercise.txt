Step 11 : Autoclicker
New upgrade to buy: Autoclick. As soon as you hit 200 score, a click is made automatically each second. (setInterval is your friend)

Step 12 : Autoclicker purchase
Autoclicked won't be automatic anymore. From now on you'll need to buy the autoclicker. Add a button with an autoclick identifier. It'll cost 500. Once the autoclicker bought, the button will have to be disabled.

Step 13 : Purchase of a bonus
From now on, we have to be able to buy a bonus that increase the score on each click by 200% for 30 seconds. It means that if you're supposed to get 3 on a click, for next 30 seconds the bonus will increase that click value to 6. After the 30 seconds the score should increase by 3 again. Create the « BONUS » button with an identifier bonus, and set the cost at 5000. Once the bonus bought, the number of seconds will be displayed in the button with the count and the button will have to be desactivated while the bonus is active. Once the bonus is over, the button have to be reactivated with the same text as before pressing it.

Step 14 : Desactivate buttons (if you don't have enough to buy them)
Make it so the buttons multiplier, autoclick and bonus can't be clicked UNLESS you have enough score to buy them.

Step 15 : Some CSS
Make it pretty ! No pictures !
