# Javascript-Cookie-clicker

A basic cookie clicker game made with JS. 

## Problems encountered

I really struggeled on when to call certain functions and how to make sure the autoclicker button was removed after having it clicked once. I learned to make separata functions for each step in the exercise, instead of nesting functions the whole time like I did during my first try (check script-1try.js in the repo).

## Code used

Javascript (& limited HTML and CSS for lay-out purposes)

## Timing

Made during the seventh week of my web development training at BeCode (october 2018).

## Status

The bonus button is not yet working properly

## Credits

Thanks to Faysal for helping me out on numerous occasions!
