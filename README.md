# Javascript-Cookie-clicker

A basic cookie clicker game made with JS. I did not add many visuals. The idea was for the code to work, not to make it a design masterpiece ;)

## Problems encountered

I really struggeled on when to call certain functions and how to make sure the autoclicker button was removed after having it clicked once. I learned to make separate functions for each step in the exercise, instead of nesting functions the whole time like I did during my first try (check script-1try.js in the repo). Also I'm still figuring out how to debug properly, as many times asking for help debugging, solved many of my issues.

## Code used

Javascript (& limited HTML and CSS for lay-out purposes)

## Timing

Made during the seventh week of my web development training at BeCode (october 2018).

## Status

Finished

## Credits

Thanks to Faysal for helping me out on numerous occasions with the debugging and finding simple solutions!
